# Peber Event Venue Website (Data1200 Exam)

## Overview

This is a static website project created for the "[Data1200 Inclusive Web Design](https://student.oslomet.no/en/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/DATA1200/2022/H%C3%98ST)" course exam. The project serves as a portfolio showcase and represents the homepage of a fictional event venue called "Peber."

## Project Background

This project was developed during our very first semester at [Oslo MET](https://www.oslomet.no/). At that time, our team had limited experience in web development, and this project served as a learning opportunity to apply our newly acquired skills.

Please keep in mind that the code and design presented here may not reflect our current skill level. We've come a long way since then, and we continue to improve our skills in web development.

## Project Details

The project was a collaborative effort by a team of five students and includes the following pages:

- **Home**: A navigation page providing links to other sections of the website.
- **Booking**: Information about the venue, how to book it, and a placeholder form (non-functional).
- **PÃ¸lseri**: Displays the opening hours and menu of a restaurant associated with the event venue.
- **Brukertilpasning**: A page explaining the theoretical aspects of user-friendliness, mainly prepared for the exam.
- **Aktuelt**: A page with a different visual style, focused on presenting textual content (text reused from another assignment).
